            <h4>Usage</h4>
            <p>Go to <a href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/">WarcraftLogs</a> and find a report you would like to analyze.</p>
            <p>Get the report code, the bolded part in <code style="word-break: break-all">https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/<b>Jba1Tgp6r3dLn29q</b>/</code>, and enter it to get the fights available.<p>
            <p>Select the fight and wait for the analysis to finish.</p>
            <h5>Private logs</h5>
            <p>
              Unfortunately WarcraftLogs does not allow third-party tools to fetch private logs and there are, currently, no plans to add support for it.
              If this is something you want, let the author of WarcraftLogs know there is a demand for it.
              In the meanwhile you have to make your private logs unlisted to analyse them.

            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>This tool analyses individual fights from WarcraftLogs reports to estimate how much extra healing was provided by various legendaries over the course of a fight.</p>
            <p>
              The accuracy of the estimation varies; for some it is completely accurate and others less so but should still give you a general idea of their effectiveness.
              Check the <a href="https://github.com/asvanberg/druid-legendary-analyser#supported-legendaries">readme</a> for more details.
            </p>
            <p>Do take into considerations that play style can heavily impact certain legendaries, most notably the <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=137095/edraith-bonds-of-aglaya">wrists</a>.</p>

            <h5>2017-05-14</h5>
            <p>
              Changed analysis of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=137042/tearstone-of-elune">Tearstone</a>
              and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item-set=1283/garb-of-the-astral-warden">4T19</a> to not attribute
              all of the healing from their respective rejuvenation application. It now works like the shoulders
              and keeps track of the time they added and only healing during that interval is counted. End result is
              a decrease for both of them and a slight increase in other extension effects.

                extension was given in milliseconds instead of seconds causing too many ticks
                to be attributed to shoulders and Deep Rooted.

                would most likely have been reapplied if they had not been extended so this should give a more honest value.
                Since extended Rejuvenations are no longer included neither is <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=189849/dreamwalker">Dreamwalker</a> healing.

              <li>Fixed a bug that caused rejuvenations applied by <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=137042/tearstone-of-elune">Tearstone</a> to be attributed to four piece <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item-set=1283/garb-of-the-astral-warden">T19</a></li>

              <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=137072/amanthuls-wisdom">Shoulders</a> have always been very hard to assign a value to, if not impossible.
              They do open up some playstyles that were otherwise impossible due to potentially ten seconds longer rejuvenations but is that valuable?
              The analyser have tried its best to give a pure numbers value to something that should probably not be evaluated as such.
              With four piece <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item-set=1283/garb-of-the-astral-warden">T19</a> it gets even more complicated and in light of
              this no attempt will be made to quantify them any more. Giving no analysis is a lot better than a wildly innacurate one.
              Do you have them and want to know how useful they are? Try them out and see how it plays.

            <p class="text-justify">
              After some discussion about <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=137072/amanthuls-wisdom">shoulders</a>
              the extra rejuvenation healing previously included is no longer. The reason being that in nearly all cases
              all it accomplished was moving the GCD used to apply the rejuvenation a few seconds back in time.
              This would only provide extra healing if there would not have been a free GCD later to cast it then instead
              and in most cases there are free GCDs. Since the extreme case where you are spamming rejuvenation for over
              18 seconds in preparation for some huge damage event is so rare, not including the rejuvenation healing is
              the correct call to give a more honest valuation of the shoulders.
